      Will this be a bio about me? I don’t think I’m good at writing at all… and even less if it is about myself; as an introverted person I find doing this terrifying!<br>

      I’ll start by introducing myself. My name is Stella Del Mar Rodriguez (Stella), a 25 years old individual lost in London for the past 6. I grew up in the south of Spain, in a beautiful seaside city called Almería. In its beaches is where I’ve got the best memories. I used to go to the beach every day since the beginning of June until beginning of September! Spending there all day with my family and cousins, swimming and having delicious home-made packed food.<br>
      A beach and the chance to swim in the sea is something I don’t have the opportunity to do since I moved here. But I can enjoy things that Almería does not have. Like all the diversity it offers. You can find anything you want just around the corner.<br>

      My life in London started when I was 19, After I finished some (VET) studies of tourism in Spain, I decided to move to London alone and become an “Au-pair” to properly learn English for a year. Little did I know that 6 years after I would still be in that foreign country doing something completely different.<br>
      I currently work in a medical practice as an administrator. It is a 9 to 5 job that pays my bills. But I wouldn’t see myself doing this for much longer. As it can get boring quite easily and I can’t really experiment and be creative as it is a very serious job and we deal with people’s health issues.

      That is why when I first heard about this “CodeYourFuture” life-changing-course,thorough a friend’s friend, my mind could not think about anything else.<br>
      I have always liked the computing matters, since I was very little. I remember I started going to ciber-coffe shops where If I pay 1 euro I would be able to use a computer with internet connexion for 1 hour. I spent lots of hours and euros in that little place. But It wasn’t until years later; when I was 15, when my parents first allowed me and my siblings to own a laptop. I remember when I first logged into a social media called “Tumblr”.Which is a customizable blog where you can personalise your blog as you please; you can create or re-blog posts like videos, quotes, poetry verses,pictures, gifs and many more things from other people’s blogs into yours. In this social media was when I got in touch with coding for the first time without even knowing that I was coding. There is a section where you can personalise your blog by changing the code.<br>
      For one year I did one mandatory subject of computing at school which I found very exciting and I used to get very great grades. So now I would love to have the opportunity to do this for a living.<br>
      I am really exited about starting this next chapter in my life that I’m sure it’s going to offer me more joy and freedom.</h3>
